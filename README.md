# module-01-practice
This repository was created solely for the practice of general data structures and algorithms
mainly in Java.

Tight refresher:
Primitives: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean
reference types: classes/arrays/interfaces/enums (any non-primitive types); the variable holds a reference (pointer) to an object on heap.

Arithmetic: + = * / %
Comparison: == != < <= > >= (for objects, use .equals)
Logical: && || !
Bitwise: & | ^ ~ << >> >>>
Ternary: cond ? a : b
++ --

Control Flow:
switch - for cases
loops - for(init; cond; update), while(cond), do{} while(cond);
break - exits loop/switch
continue - skips to next iteration
